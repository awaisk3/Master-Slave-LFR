# Master-Slave-LFR
This project was implemented using Arduino UNO-R3. I used 2 IR sensors for Line detection and 1 Ultrasonic sensor for detecting obstacles. I also used IR sensors as Transmitter and Receiver to perform operation of Master-Slave. Master Robot was to perform these operations and Slave Robot was to follow actions of Master Robot.
